# Minimal Weather App
## Introduction
A cloned minimal weather app written in Flutter originally created by Mitch Koko. A video guide (created by the same user) can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLtpMqvMgdY&ab_channel=MitchKoko).

## Setup
1. Create an account and get the API key from https://openweathermap.org/
2. Under the assets folder create the file `api_key.txt` and add the API key to that file (nothing else)

## Limitations
There are only four Lottie animations at the moment but more can be added by:

1. Adding the Lottie animations to the assets folder
2. Mapping the weather conditions to the new Lottie animations in the function `getWeatherAnimation` under `weather_page.dart`
